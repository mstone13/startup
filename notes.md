## HTML Notes

Initial changes were made to the index.html and to_do_list.html files. I also renamed the files in order to better recognize which files had which purpose. I learned how to change the background color of just the header/main body. 
- Using an input type allows users to change the text on the site. This is important for when users want to change the name of their to-do lists (the purpose is to have to-do lists for multiple classes). 
- <button> creates a button. I have added a placeholder button in the account.html file that will allow users to create an account if they don't already have one.
