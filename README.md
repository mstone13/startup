# Calendar/Planner Site

[My Notes](notes.md)

This site will eventually become a functional calendar app as well as a place to keep multiple to-do lists, perfect for college students juggling multiple classes and assignments. Users will be able to connect with other users and create events with their friends that will appear on both calendars! Users will also be able to connect events to a location using a third-party mapping API.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

This startup includes a calendar to add events as well as multiple to-do lists for differing classes. 

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have trouble organizing your assignments and daily events? This site will be your go-to for all your organization efforts. Work with other users to coordinate events, locate your upcoming events, and keep yourself organized!

### Design

The index.html page displays the user login and a table including different times throughout the day--eventually, users will be able to scroll through the entire 24 hour calendar and add events whenever they want. This page also displays notifications from other users and a third-party API to map locations to certain events.

The to-do-list.html page focuses mainly on multiple to-do lists, which the user can name and connect to different classes. They then can add items, assignments, and projects to these lists to stay organized.

The account.html page presents the user's information, such as their username, email, and date of joining the site.

Lastly, the other-users.html page focuses on finding and friending other users. Users will be able to see their friends usernames and events that are common between calendars, granted that both users give permission.


### Key features
